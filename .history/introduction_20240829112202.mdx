## Introduction to Rapydo
In the cloud-native ecosystem, databases represent a critical junction where efficiency meets scalability. The traditional approach to database management, characterized by manual, infrequent updates, has been replaced by a demand for agility and speed. Yet, this shift has brought its own set of challenges: exorbitantly high infrastructure costs to accommodate legacy code inefficiencies, frequent interference with database SLAs making them the weakest link in application scaling strategies, and a dire need for effective observability across expansive database fleets. Current tools focused on single-server insights fall short in managing large fleets of database instances, lacking real-time monitoring and actionable recommendations. Identifying queries or jobs that hog resources is one thing; fixing them with minimal development effort in large organizations is an entirely different ballgame.

## How Rapydo is Changing the Way DB Operations Work?

Rapydo introduces a non-intrusive Observability Solution, capable of monitoring thousands of Managed DB Instances like Amazon RDS. It's not just about aggregating cross-database insights; Rapydo focuses on delivering implementable recommendations within seconds via Rapydo Cortex. This breakthrough approach eliminates database bottlenecks without any development efforts.

Focusing on our Cortex product, we empower operational teams—Site Reliability Engineers, Database Reliability Engineers, DevOps, and Platform Engineering teams—with granular control over the queries hitting the database. Cortex's unique, rule-based engine supports any query load, allowing companies to manage queries, users, or endpoints efficiently.
