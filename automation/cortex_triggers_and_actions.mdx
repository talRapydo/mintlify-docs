**Triggers** - events that are defined by the user, for example: The CPU Utilization of the database machine is over 90%.

**Actions** - the measures that the user defines for the system to take if a certain triggers (conditions) are met.

### Trigger Types

* **Query pattern** - the action(s) will be triggered when the current query matches the given query pattern.
* **Query Duration** - the action(s) will be triggered when the current query duration is greater than the specified duration.
* **User(s)** - the action(s) will be triggered when a user or users are connecting to the database.
* **IP(s)** - The action(s) will be triggered when a host with a specific IP address connects to the database.
* **Time** - The action(s) will be triggered in a specific time frame only. 

### Trigger Operator Types

* **In** - this operator is relevant to the Trigger types: User(s) and IP(s), and allows us to define a few IP addresses or Users that will trigger the action(s) defined.
* **Not In** - similar to the operator In but it is used for triggering an action when the IPs or Users are not included in the given list.
* **Like** - this operator is relevant to the Trigger types: Query Pattern, and it allows us to define a pattern that includes a few queries that will trigger the action(s) defined.
* **Not Like** - similar to the operator Like but it is used for triggering an action when the given query pattern does not include the current query.
* **Is Greater Than** - this operator is relevant to the Trigger type Query Duration.

### Trigger Values

* **Query pattern** - the string of the query pattern.
* **Query Duration** - the time above which the action will be triggered.
* **User(s)** - a comma separated list of a User(s).
* **IP(s)** - a comma separated list of a IP(s).
* **Time** - start and end times of the trigger, with frequency options: daily, weekly, or monthly. The weekly option lets us choose specific days for the trigger, and the monthly option lets us select a specific day of the month.

### Action Types

* **Block** - Blocks the current request based on the trigger type and value. 
* **Throttle** - Throttle resources of the current request to a defined based on the trigger type and value.
* **Rate Limit** - Limit the resources of the current request request to a defined based on the trigger type and value.
* **Rewrite** - Change the current query request to a different request based on the action value.

### Action Values

* **Block** - No value. 
* **Throttle** - Limit the resources of the current request request to a defined based on the trigger type and value. All requests above the limit will be queued.
* **Rate Limit** - Limit the resources of the current request request to a defined based on the trigger type and value. All requests above the limit will be ignored.
* **Rewrite** - The query string that we replace the original query with.
