Triggers are events that are defiend by the user, for example: The CPU Utilization of the database machine is over 90%.

Actions are the measures that the user defines for the system to take if a certain triggers (conditions) are met.  

### Rapydo supports four main categories of triggers
 
#### Applicative Database Usage Triggers

These are based on changes in database-specific metrics, including:

* Query pattern and Query Duration
* Users and IPs
* Database name and Connection utilization
* Time based triggers

#### Machine Metric Triggers

These are derived from changes in system-level metrics, such as:

* CPU Utilization
* Free Memory
* Max Query Duration
* Read and Write IOPS
* Counts: users, hosts, waits, connections, DBs

#### Cache Rules 
These rules are triggered by a query or table which are predefined in the triggers and can automate the caching or the pass-through of queries which fit a certain query pattern.

#### Rules triggered by an execution of a user-defined rule 
These are alerts which are triggered by the execution of other user-defined rules, allowing for complex, multi-step automations.
